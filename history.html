                    <h2>1972</h2>
                    <p>Hybrid Commute first opened its doors in November of 1972! Bit and Byte Smith were new to Omaha and discovered an empty building on the corner of 5th and Hypertext Avenue. They always dreamed of opening up their own transportation company. That dream came true in the Fall of 1972 when they purchased the building and began construction on Hybrid Commute. They decided to have a grand opening on Thanksgiving Day and offered free sample services to all who attended. This became a tradition that is still being followed to this day. Every Thanksgiving Day, the Downtown Diner opens its doors and give discount to their services.</p>

                    <h2>1994</h2>
                    <p>In 1994, Bit and Byte decided it was time to retire. They turned over the reins of the commute and travel guidance to their son, Chip. Chip continues to manage Hybrid Commute today with the help of his wife, Drive. Chip and Drive have added a few of their own special services to the menu. But for the most part, the menu hasn't change too much from the original one.</p>
